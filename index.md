I am a graduate student in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

I currently hold an assistantship with the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.illinois.edu). I will spend my summer of 2022 working as a data scientist intern for [Gopuff](https://gopuff.com/go/about-us).
